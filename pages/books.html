                    is a 1997 fantasy novel written by British author J. K. Rowling.
                    The first novel in the Harry Potter series and Rowling's debut novel, it follows Harry Potter,
                    a young wizard who discovers his magical heritage on his eleventh birthday,
                    when he receives a letter of acceptance to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
                    Harry makes close friends and a few enemies during his first year at the school
                    and with the help of his friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger,
                    he faces an attempted comeback by the dark wizard Lord Voldemort,
                    who killed Harry's parents, but failed to kill Harry when he was just 15 months old.

                    The book was first published in the United Kingdom on 26 June 1997 by Bloomsbury.
                    It was published in the United States the following year by Scholastic Corporation
                    under the title Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone. It won most of the British book awards
                    that were judged by children and other awards in the US. The book reached the top of the New York Times list
                    of best-selling fiction in August 1999 and stayed near the top of that list for much of 1999 and 2000.
                    It has been translated into at least 73 other languages and has been made into a feature-length film of the same name,
                    as have all six of its sequels. The novel has sold in excess of 120 million copies,
                    making it the third best-selling novel of all time.

                    <b>Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</b>
                    is a fantasy novel written by British author J. K. Rowling
                    and the second novel in the Harry Potter series. The plot follows Harry's second year
                    at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, during which a series of messages
                    on the walls of the school's corridors warn that the "Chamber of Secrets" has been opened
                    and that the "heir of Slytherin" would kill all pupils who do not come from all-magical families.
                    These threats are found after attacks that leave residents of the school petrified.
                    Throughout the year, Harry and his friends Ron and Hermione investigate the attacks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The book was published in the United Kingdom on 2 July 1998 by Bloomsbury
                    and later in the United States on 2 June 1999 by Scholastic Inc.
                    Although Rowling says she found it difficult to finish the book, it won high praise and awards from critics,
                    young readers, and the book industry, although some critics thought the story was perhaps too frightening
                    for younger children. Much like with other novels in the series, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets
                    triggered religious debates; some religious authorities have condemned its use of magical themes,
                    whereas others have praised its emphasis on self-sacrifice and the way one's character is the result of one's choices.

                    and the sixth and penultimate novel in the Harry Potter series.
                    Set during Harry Potter's sixth year at Hogwarts, the novel explores the past of the boy wizard's nemesis,
                    Lord Voldemort, and Harry's preparations for the final battle against Voldemort
                    alongside his headmaster and mentor Albus Dumbledore.

                    a record eventually broken by its sequel, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.
                    There were many controversies before and after it was published,
                    including the right-to-read copies delivered before the release date in Canada.
                    Reception to the novel was generally positive, and it won several awards and honours,
                    including the 2006 British Book of the Year award.

                    Reviewers noted that the book had a darker tone than its predecessors, though it did contain some humour.
                    Some considered the main themes love, death, trust, and redemption.
                    The considerable character development of Harry and many other teenage characters also drew attention.
