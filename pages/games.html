                    <b>Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone</b>
                    (released in the United States as <b>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</b>)
                    is an action-adventure video game based on the 2001 film of the same name.
                    Philosopher's Stone was initially released for the Game Boy Advance, Game Boy Color,
                    Microsoft Windows, and PlayStation in November 2001.
                    A different game bearing the same name was made two years later for the GameCube,
                    PlayStation 2, and Xbox in December 2003.
                    The versions on different platforms differ greatly from each other
                    and do not follow the same level structures or gameplay,
                    with somewhat varying stories as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The story follows protagonist Harry Potter, who, after discovering he is a wizard,
                    is sent to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry where he makes friends
                    and receives magical training, and along with his friends stop Lord Voldemort
                    from returning to power. The game received mixed reviews,
                    with critics saying that the game's license would be the only thing to draw in fans.
                    The PlayStation version sold 8 million copies by May 2003,
                    which would become Argonaut's best-selling game
                    and one of the best-selling PlayStation video games of all time.
